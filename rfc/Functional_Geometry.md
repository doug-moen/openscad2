# Functional Geometry

Functional geometry is the techne of defining geometric objects using functions.
These functions map each point [x,y,z] in space onto some property of the object.
The underlying representation is called F-Rep (functional representation),
in contrast to the B-Rep (boundary representation) currently used by OpenSCAD.

## Functional Geometry is Awesome

Functional geometry is awesome because
* Curved objects are represented exactly, rather than as polygonal approximations.
  Therefore, they don't lose resolution when they are scaled or transformed.
* Functional Geometry APIs are a simple and elegant way to solve many modelling problems,
  especially when modelling curved surfaces and organic shapes.
* Plus all of the speed and efficiency benefits described by [Efficient Geometry](Efficient_Geometry.md).

## Functional Geometry is Gaining Popularity

Functional geometry is gaining popularity in the 3D printing community.
Here are some 3D modelling tools that use it:
* [ImplicitCAD](http://www.implicitcad.org/) 2011
* [ShapeJS](http://shapejs.shapeways.com/) 2013
* [IceSL](http://www.loria.fr/~slefebvr/icesl/) 2013
* [Antimony](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/) 2014

Each of these tools uses a different design for the graphics kernel.

ImplicitCAD is a pure F-Rep system written in Haskell.
ImplicitCAD has really good functional representations for primitives.
The rounded cuboid is much simpler and faster than Antimony's code.
ImplicitCAD has problems: its STL export is slow and of poor quality.

ShapeJS's geometry kernel is AbFab3D, written in Java.
It's a voxel based with F-Rep inside, and it is memory intensive.
It's sponsored by Shapeways, so there is SVX support,
and a lot of work has been done on the STL export code.

IceSL is a hybrid of B-Rep, together with a pure? F-Rep system.
It gets speed by using a GPU to preview the geometry, or generate G-Code.
(F-Rep is highly parallizeable, and well suited to GPU implementation.)
No STL support. No source code, it's proprietary.

Antimony uses Adaptively Sampled Distance Fields (ASDF),
which wraps F-Rep within a hierarchical oct-tree like structure
for improved scaleability. The kernel is written in C++, but most of
the graphics primitives are written in Python for extensibility.
Preview seems really fast (compared to OpenSCAD).
STL generation is fast and high quality: it uses edge and feature detection
to avoid the obvious glitches seen in ImplicitCAD generated STL.

## My Approach

This paper is a good tutorial on how Functional Geometry works,
and it also presents an original approach, which I'll call OpenFG,
on how functional geometry can be integrated into a modelling language.

I think my approach is more elegant, powerful, and easy to use, than
any other FG system that I've looked at so far. It introduces a single
shape constructor `make_shape`, and implements most of the OpenSCAD geometry
primitives, 2D and 3D, in a few hundred lines of OpenSCAD2 code.

## Functional Representation (F-Rep)

The mathematical equation for a sphere of radius `r` is `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2`.

We can rewrite this as `x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2 = 0`.

The above is an *implicit equation*,
from which we can derive the *implicit function*
```
f[x,y,z] = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2
```

`f[x,y,z]` is:
* zero if the point [x,y,z] is on the boundary of the sphere
* negative if the point is inside the sphere
* positive if the point is outside the sphere

More generally, `f[x,y,z]` is the distance of the point from the sphere's boundary,
and `f` is called a *signed distance function*, a *distance function*, or a *distance field*.
The 3D surface defined by `f[x,y,z]==0` is an *isosurface*.
`f` represents a sphere of radius `r` in F-Rep.
(Although we use a slightly different definition in practice; see below.)

There's one more wrinkle.
In F-Rep, a distance function maps every point in 3D space onto a signed distance.
This representation is not restricted to representing finite geometrical objects.
It can also represent infinite space-filling patterns.
For examples, try a Google image search on
[k3dsurf periodic lattice](https://www.google.ca/search?q=k3dsurf+periodic+lattice&tbm=isch).
These infinite patterns are useful in 3D modelling:
you can intersect them or subtract them from a finite 3D object.

An essay on
[the mathematical basis of F-Rep](https://christopherolah.wordpress.com/2011/11/06/manipulation-of-implicit-functions-with-an-eye-on-cad/)
by Christopher Olah, inventor of ImplicitCAD.

## Performance
With B-Rep, CSG operations are algorithmically challenging.
It is very expensive to generate the mesh.
CPU and memory costs increase non-linearly with resolution.
Once you have the mesh, preview is fast
(but even then, preview of large meshes is sluggish in OpenSCAD).

With F-Rep, the in-memory representation is a function closure,
with the hierachical structure of a CSG tree
of operation nodes and argument values.
Therefore, CSG operations are fast and occur in constant time,
and the memory cost is very low.
The representation is resolution independent.
However, rendering to the screen (preview) is expensive, since you have
to call the distance function zillions of times.

To speed up rendering, various approaches are used:
* IceSL solves the problem using brute force. It uses the FPU for rendering,
  and requires a high-end FPU on an Intel platform.
  This works: preview is very fast, and they allegedly update
  the preview on every keystroke as you edit an OpenSCAD script.
  F-Rep is highly parallelizable, and well suited for FPU rendering.
* You can cache distance values in a voxel array.
  This is what ShapeJS and AbFab3D do.
  But this is memory intensive: AbFab3D recommends a 64 bit JVM,
  and ShapeJS has a web GUI where the heavy lifting is done by a Shapeways server.
* Antimony uses ASDF (Adaptively Sampled Distance Fields). You cache distance values in
  a hierarchical data structure based on an oct-tree, and use interpolation to
  reconstruct values that aren't explicitly stored. The "adaptive" part means
  that subvolumes with a lot of detail are sampled at a higher resolution than
  smoother subvolumes. (By contrast, voxel grids are "regularly sampled distance fields".)
  This approach requires less memory than a voxel grid, a regular voxel oct-tree, or a mesh.

## Low Level API
In OpenSCAD2, functional geometry has both a low-level and a high-level API.
* The high level API includes familiar operations like sphere(), translate() and intersection(),
  plus exciting new operations like shell() and perimeter_extrude().
* The low level API allows users to directly define new primitive operations
  using distance functions, and is perhaps the analogue of polyhedron() for B-Rep.

`3dshape(f([x,y,z])=..., bbox=[[x1,y1,z1],[x2,y2,z2]])`
> Returns a functional 3D shape, specified by a distance function.
> The bounding box is required for implementation reasons: there is
> no cheap way to compute it from `f`. The bounding box can be larger
> than necessary, but any tendrils of the shape that extend beyond
> the bounding box will be truncated.

`3dpattern(f([x,y,z])=...)`
> Returns a potentially infinite, space filling 3D pattern.
> You can intersect this with a 3D shape, or subtract it from a 3D shape,
> which yields another finite 3D shape. But you can't export a 3D pattern
> to an STL file.

`2dshape` and `2dpattern` are the 2 dimensional analogues of the above.

The low level API contains utility operations that are used
to define new operations that map shapes onto shapes.
Shapes can be queried at run-time for their distance function
and their bounding box.

`shape.f`
> the distance function of a shape

`shape.bbox`
> the bounding box of a shape

## Weird Shapes
A distance function can express an arbitrary set of points in 3-space,
which could be a 2D surface, a 1D path, an isolated 0D point,
or a [fractal with a non-integer Hausdorff dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension).
It's not limited to well formed, finite 3D solids.
* The upside is that this is very powerful and expressive. We can make productive use of weird shapes,
  and I haven't explored all of the possibilities yet.
* The downside is that we are giving users the ability to create pathological, malformed distance functions,
  and we have little ability to detect a malformed function and issue an error message.
  So we need to ensure that preview, STL export and SVX export produce some kind of valid result
  even if the distance function is pathological. We can't enter an infinite loop, crash, or export
  a non-manifold STL file.

Infinite space filling patterns are useful. They can be intersected with or subtracted from finite 3D solids.
Existing functional geometry systems make good use of this.
My insight is that we should use the bounding box [[-inf,-inf,-inf],[inf,inf,inf]] if the pattern is infinite in all directions. An infinite cylinder extending along the Z axis, with unit radius, would have bounding box [[-1,-1,-inf],[1,1,inf]]. Following this strategy, the intersection of the X, Y and Z cylinders would have a finite bbox with no special case code. is_finite(shape) tests the bounding box to determine if a shape is finite.

The empty set is a useful pattern. In ImplicitCAD, the bbox for the empty set is [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], and there is ugly special case code in union to ignore empty shapes when computing the bbox for a union. Perhaps a better bbox for the empty shape is [[inf,inf,inf],[-inf,-inf,-inf]]. This has a height, width and depth of -inf, and may turn out to work correctly in bbox calculations with no special case code. Check and see when the Tutorial is complete. is_empty(shape) returns true if the height, width or depth of the bbox is <= 0.

A 2D object occupying the X-Y plane is directly expressible, without introducing a special type for 2D shapes,
or introducing a "2D subsystem".
```
square(n) = cuboid([n,n,0]);
```
We can test for a 2D object: minz and maxz are 0, width and depth are > 0.
So can we use this representation without any special casing? Do all of the polymorphic shape operators work
correctly on this representation without special casing? I think preview would work.

The PLASM language supports 1D shapes, and these are commonly used. A 3D cylinder is constructed as the cross-product
of a 1D line segment by a 2D circle. This would also work in Functional Geometry.
So this is something to play with in the future. Nothing new needs to be added to support this.

## Examples
In this section, we define a sample collection of high level operations in OpenSCAD2,
to demonstrate how easy it is to define shapes using functional geometry.
(The code for implementing any of these operations using a mesh is far more complex.)
The issue of what the standard high level API will be, and how backwards compatibility works,
is left to a later date.

### Primitive Shapes
Here I'll define 3 primitive shapes: sphere, cuboid and cylinder.
The main lesson will be learning how to write a distance function.

```
sphere(r) = 3dshape(
    f([x,y,z]) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - r,
    bbox=[[-r,-r,-r],[r,r,r]]);
```

In the F-Rep section, I said that `f([x,y,z]) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2`
is a distance function for a sphere, so why did we change it?

There are many different ways to write a distance function that produce the same visible result.
The main requirement is that the isosurface of the distance function at 0
(the set of all points such that f[x,y,z] == 0)
is the boundary of the desired object, and there are infinitely many functions that satisfy this
requirement for any given shape.

But the isosurface at 0 is not the only thing you need to consider.
A distance function defines an infinite family of isosurfaces,
and they are all important, particular when you use the `shell` primitive.
Consider
```
sp = sphere(10);
```
`sp.f` is the distance function. Because of the way we defined `sphere`,
the isosurface of `sp.f` at -1 is a sphere of radius 9, the isosurface at 1
is a sphere of radius 11, and so on. All of the isosurfaces of `sp` are spheres.
As a result, `shell(1) sp` will return a spherical shell with outer radius 10
and inner radius 9. The `shell` operator provides direct access to the other isosurfaces.
(See the Shell section, which is later.)

```
cuboid(sz) = 3dshape(
  f([x,y,z]) = max([abs(x-sz.x/2), abs(y-sz.y/2), abs(z-sz.z/2)]),
  bbox=[ [0,0,0], sz ]);
```
I have similar comments for `cuboid`.
The distance function is designed so that all of the isosurfaces of a given
cuboid are nested cuboids, and `shell` works as expected.

Here's a thought experiment. Consider defining the distance function for `cuboid`
so the the distance to the boundary is measured in millimeters along a vector that points to the centre.
With this definition, only the isosurface at 0 would be a true cuboid. The isosurfaces at positive values
would have increasingly convex sides, so that at large values, the surface would approach a sphere.
The isosurfaces at negative values would have increasingly concave sides.
This behaviour would be visible using `shell`.

Note the use of `max` in the distance function for `cuboid`.
Generally speaking, if your distance function computes the max of a function of `x` and a function of `y`,
then your shape will have a right angle between the X and Y axes.
Read [Olah's essay](https://christopherolah.wordpress.com/2011/11/06/manipulation-of-implicit-functions-with-an-eye-on-cad/) for more discussion of this.

```
cylinder(h,r) = linear_extrude(h=h) circle(r);
```

```
circle(r) = 2dshape(
    f([x,y]) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - r,
    bbox=[[-r,-r],[r,r]]);
```

```
linear_extrude(h)(shape) = 3dshape(
    f([x,y,z]) = max(shape.f(x,y), abs(z - h/2) - h/2),
    bbox=[ [shape.bbox[0].x,shape.bbox[0].y,-h/2], [shape.bbox[1].x,shape.bbox[1].y,h/2] ]);
```
> The result of `linear_extrude` is centred.

The distance function for `linear_extrude` computes the max
of a function of x & y with a function of z,
and the result is a right angle between the X/Y plane and the Z axis.
See above.

### Translation
translate(), align(), pack???.
No need for center= options.

### Shell

#### `shell(n) shape`
hollows out the specified shape, leaving only a shell of the specified
thickness.
An analogy is 3D printing a shape without infill.

```
shell(w)(shape) = 3dshape(
  f(p) = abs(shape.f(p) + w/2) - w/2,
  bbox = shape.bbox );
```
Explanation:
* `f(p) = abs(shape.f(p))` is the zero-thickness shell of `shape`.
* `f(p) = abs(shape.f(p)) - n` (for positive n) is a shell of thickness `n*2`,
  centered on the zero-thickness shell given above.
* `f(p) = shape.f(p) + n` (for positive n) is the isosurface of `shape` at `-n`
  (it's smaller than `shape`)

#### `inflate(n) shape`
returns the isosurface of `shape` at value `n`.
Positive values of `n` create a larger version of `shape`,
`n==0` is the identity transformation,
and negative values "deflate" the shape.
This is different from the scale transformation; it's more like
inflating a shape like a balloon, especially for non-convex objects.

![inflate](img/inflate.png)

```
inflate(n)(shape) = 3dshape(
  f(p) = shape.f(p) - n,
  bbox=[ shape.bbox[0]-n, shape.bbox[1]+n ]);
```
TODO: is the bbox calculation correct in all cases?

### Scaling
the effect of non-isotropic scaling on `shell`. Need for `spheroid`.

### CSG Operations
everything, nothing, complement,
union, intersection, difference

meaning of 'max' and 'min' in a distance function

Note: ImplicitCAD and Antimony use max for union and min for intersection.
Although this is a common implementation, [Schmitt 2002]
(http://grenet.drimm.u-bordeaux1.fr/pdf/2002/SCHMITT_BENJAMIN_2002.pdf)
says "it is well known that using min/max functions for set-theoretic
operations causes problems in further transformations of the model due to C1 discontinuity of
the resulting function (see Fig. 1.3). Further blending, offsetting, or metamorphosis can result
in unnecessary creases, edges, and tearing of such an object." (page 26, and figure 1.3 on page 20).
His solution is to use an alternative function, one which is differentiable.
My interpretation is that you need to round any sharp edges and add fillets to sharp corners
to avoid this alleged problem. I'm going to wait and see if we can actually detect a problem
once we have working code, before worrying about a fix.

### Rounded edges and Fillets
rcuboid, runion

### Perimeter_extrude

### Unclassified
```
rcuboid(r,sz) = 3dshape(
  f([x,y,z]) = rmax(r, [abs(x-sz.x/2), abs(y-sz.y/2), abs(z-sz.z/2)]),
  bbox=[ [0,0,0], sz ]);
```
> Cuboid with rounded corners (radius=r) from ImplicitCAD.
> All ImplicitCAD primitives that generate sharp corners have a rounding option.
> `rmax` is a utility function for creating rounded corners.

```
union(s1,s2) = 3dshape(
    f(p) = min(s1.f(p), s2.f(p)),
    bbox=[ min(s1.bbox[0],s2.bbox[0]), max(s1.bbox[1],s2.bbox[1]) ]);
```
> Simplest case of a union. ImplicitCAD uses special case code where the
> min and max in the bbox calculation ignore empty bounding boxes, but I've
> omitted that for clarity.

```
runion(r,s1,s2) = 3dshape(
    f(p) = rmin(r, s1.f(p), s2.f(p)),
    bbox=[ min(s1.bbox[0],s2.bbox[0])-r, max(s1.bbox[1],s2.bbox[1])+r ]);
```
> Create fillets! ImplicitCAD rounded union with radius `r`. (Why is the bbox padded by r?)
Example:
  ```
  runion(r=8,
  	cube([40,40,20]),
  	translate([0,0,20]) cube([20,20,30]))
  ```
![rounded union](http://thingiverse-rerender-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/47/9e/1c/c8/e2/RoundedUnionCubeExample_preview_featured.jpg)





```
complement(s) = 3dpattern(f(p) = -s.f(p));
```
> Convert a shape or pattern to its inverse: all points inside the object
> are now outside, and vice versa.
