# Sequences

OpenSCAD has the following types for representing an ordered sequence of values:
* a list [a,b,c] is a sequence of arbitrary values
* a string "abc" is a sequence of Unicode code points
* a range [1:10] is a sequence of numbers
* a group `group(){cube(c);sphere(s);}` is a sequence of shapes.
  As a special case, `children()` is the group of shape arguments passed to a module.

OpenSCAD has generic operations on sequences,
but not all operations are supported on all sequence types.

|                   |list |string|range|group|`children()`
|-------------------|-----|------|-----|-----|----------
|len(seq)           | yes | yes  | -   | -   |`$nchildren`
|seq[i]             | yes | yes  | -   | -   |`children(i)`
|for (i=seq) ...    | yes | -    | yes | -   |-
|concat(seq1, seq2) | yes | *    | -   | -   |-
|has empty sequences| yes | yes  | -   | yes |yes
|slice notation     | -   | -    | -   | -   |`children(i,j)`

Note that strings can be concatenated using `str(s1,s2)`.

The goal of this RFC is to make all features available to all sequence types.
The rationale is simplicity, consistency and [Composability](Composable_Building_Blocks.md).

## Generalized Strings
* `for` is extended so that it iterates over the characters in a string
* `concat` is extended so that it concatenates strings.
  The arguments to `concat` must be either all strings (the result is a string),
  or all non-strings (the result is a list).

## Generalized Ranges
Ranges are generalized so that empty ranges are supported.
If the end of the range is < the start of the range (with positive step value),
then the range is empty (consistent with Haskell).
Plus, we extend all of the generic sequence operations to ranges.

I'm concerned that this will affect backwards compatibility,
since at present, `[10:1]` is equivalent to `[10:-1:1]`.
Also, you can currently use r[0], r[1], r[2] to reference the start, step and end values of a range:
maybe there's code out there that uses this.

My solution is to introduce a new range syntax, which will
support the new range semantics, and leave the old range values
to work as they always have (but the old ranges will be deprecated).

The new range syntax is taken from Haskell.
I claim that the Haskell syntax is easier to understand,
and that this will improve ease of use.
* range with step 1: `[start..end]`
* range with step k: `[start,start+k..end]`

The new range values work with all of the generic sequence operations.
You can `concat` two ranges, or a range and a list,
and the result will be a list.

Although new ranges are represented internally as 3 numbers,
at the language and user level, they
are operationally indistinguishable from lists, therefore they are lists.
For example, `echo([1..5])` prints `[1,2,3,4,5]`.
Ranges in Python2 and Haskell work the same way.

## Generalized Slice Notation
The only place we currently support slice notation is `children(i,j)`.
Since this syntax is going to be deprecated,
I'd like a new generalized slice notation syntax available to take its place
when code is upgraded to the new OpenSCAD2 syntax.

The new slice notation is taken from Rust:
* `seq[start..end]`
* `seq[start..]`
* `seq[..end]`

Slice notation makes it easier to write recursive functions over lists.
Here is `sumv` from MichaelAtOz's `vectormath.scad`.
The `i` and `s` parameters allow you to sum a either a slice of the list, or the entire list.

```
function sumv(v,i,s=0) = (i==s ? v[i] : v[i] + sumv(v,i-1,s));
```

Using slices, we can define a simpler function `sum`, which doesn't require the parameters `i` and `s`.
If you need to sum only part of the list, you just pass a slice.

```
function sum(v) = v==[] ? 0 : v[0] + sum(v[1..]);
```

## Unify Lists and Groups
As part of [First Class Values](First_Class_Values.md),
we will make shapes into first class values.
There is no longer a reason for lists and groups to be separate types,
so we will replace groups with lists.
The old syntax that previously produced a group,
will now produce a list of shapes.
