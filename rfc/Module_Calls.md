# Module Calls
A module call (or module instantiation) returns a shape or a group of shapes.

In OpenSCAD2, shapes and groups become [first class values](First_Class_Values.md).
Module calls are now legal within expressions.
Modules themselves are first class values.
Designing the syntax and semantics of module call expressions
while retaining backward compatibility
is the biggest challenge in the design of OpenSCAD2.

## Two Kinds of Modules
## Modules are Functions
## Module Calls in Statements
## Module Calls in Expressions
