# Declarative Semantics

OpenSCAD is intended to have declarative or functional semantics,
which are free of side effects.
So you can't increment a variable or mutate a data structure.
But "side effect free" is a negative definition: why is this a good thing?

In the functional or declarative style of programming:
* order independent
* simple semantics
* compositional, composable
* easy to reason about
* equational reasoning
* useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs
