# First Class Values

In OpenSCAD2, every thing that can be referenced or manipulated by OpenSCAD code is a first class value.
This means:
* It can be passed as an argument to a function.
* It can be returned as a result from a function.
* It can be an element of a list.
* It can be written as a literal expression.
  This means we have anonymous function literals.
* It can be printed as a valid OpenSCAD expression using `echo`.
* It can be given a name using definition syntax: `name = value;`.

This can't happen until the value, function and module namespaces
have been unified into a single namespace.

## First Class Numbers
Currently, numbers are not first class values.
That's because `1/0` prints as `inf`,
and `0/0` prints as `nan`,
but neither `inf` nor `nan` are valid expressions.
