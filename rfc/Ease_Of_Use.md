# Ease Of Use

OpenSCAD is meant to be easy to use.
It has proven to have a low barrier of entry for beginners,
and we want to preserve this.

OpenSCAD is a powerful 3D modelling tool, not a programming language,
and it is designed to meet the needs of people who want to do 3D modelling
(and who may not be experienced programmers). It is not designed to meet the
needs of computer programmers. Therefore, ease of use for non-programmers
is of primary importance, and we need to make different design choices than
the ones made for general purpose programming languages.
Here are examples:
* declarative/functional semantics
* no support for "programming in the large"
