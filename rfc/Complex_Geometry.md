# Complex Geometry: Materials, Colours and Micro-fine Detail

This is a roadmap for evolving OpenSCAD to solve the following problems:
* Support objects with multiple materials and colours.
* Support complex objects with micro-fine detail (more structure than can
  be feasibly represented by a mesh).
