# The GEOME geometry library

GEOME is an easy to use and powerful geometry library.
It lets you construct, compose and transform shapes using simple, composable, orthogonal operations.

The main design principles are simplicity, composability and orthogonality.
Avoid functions with lots of arguments (break out that functionality into separate operators).
Avoid multiple functions with similar names that do minor variants on the same thing:
instead, provide a single function plus "adverb" operations to tweak the output.

All shapes are OpenSCAD2 customizable objects.
The API exposed by shape objects is TBD.
You can literally write `cube;` as your first GEOME program,
and you'll get a standard size cube centered at the origin.
Use operators to modify and place the cube.

Some of the names in GEOME shadow built-in names.
That's okay because OpenSCAD2 is lexically scoped.
You can use GEOME together with other libraries and there won't be name conflicts
(if you use another library, it won't accidently use GEOME's definition of `cube` or `scale`).

## Standard Shapes
The first 8 shapes are the primitive shapes from
[Conway's polyhedron notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation).
* `tetrahedron` (`== pyramid(3)`)
* `cube` (`== prism(4)`)
* `octahedron`
* `dodecahedron`
* `icosahedron`
* `prism(n)` // prism whose base is a regular n-gon
* `antiprism(n)`
* `pyramid(n)` // base is a regular n-gon
* `cone`
* `cylinder`
* `geodesic(v)` // an order-v geodesic sphere. `geodesic(1) == isosahedron`.

## Affine Transformations
An affine transformation T is a function that maps a shape to a shape.
But also, you can compose affine transformations using T1 * T2.
* `move(x,y,z)`
* `rotate(x,y,z)`
* `scale(x,y,z)`
* `mirror(x,y,z)`
* ...

## Arrangement Operators
The arrangement operators position objects relative to one another,
or relative to the axes.
There's no `center` argument to `cube`. Instead, you can use `align`
to align it relative to the x,y,z axes.
Details TBD.

## Conway Transformations
All of [Conway's operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation)
on convex regular polyhedra are included.
The domain of these operators may have to be restricted to convex regular polyhedra. We'll see.

## Other Shape Transformations
* `wireframe(shape)` // convert any polyhedron to a wireframe
* `tubify(shape)` // works on prisms and cylinders

## Low Level Polyhedron Operations
The `polyhedron` module is very powerful, as it can create any polyhedron.
It's quite difficult to use correctly, since it's easy to have "inside out" faces,
and there are no error messages for this.
It would be nice to have a set of low level operations for directly constructing polyhedra
which (a) can construct any valid polyhedron, and (b) cannot construct an invalid polyhedron.

I don't really know how to do this.
* Runsun's "faces" library is interesting.
* The [Euler Operators](http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/model/euler-op.html)
are interesting: they can construct any valid polyhedron, and they guarantee that any object they
create obeys the [Euler-Poincar√© Formula](http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/model/euler.html).
Alas, the intermediate construction steps are often not valid polyhedra. They aren't that easy to use.

## Parametric Shape Constructors
Use parametric functions to construct shapes. TBD.

## Influences
GEOME is designed entirely by ripping off other people's ideas,
and then packaging those ideas into simple, composable and orthogonal shape operators.
Some influences (incomplete):
* John Conway
* George Hart
* Henry Baker's transformation matrix library for OpenSCAD
* Kit Wallace
* ...

Other systems I still need to look at:
* [ShapeJS](http://abfab3d.com/)
* [Generative Modelling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Modelling_Language)
