# Better abstraction mechanisms for OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD2 is a backward compatible redesign of the [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org/) language.
The goals are:
 1. to make OpenSCAD easier to use;
 2. to make OpenSCAD more expressive and powerful, not by adding complexity and piling on features, but by making the core language simpler and more uniform, and by removing restrictions on how language elements can be composed together to create larger components.

**Summary**: Everything is now a first class value. Functions, modules, shapes, groups and even OpenSCAD scripts are first class values.

**Why Is This So Big?** Making everything first class while retaining backward compatibility is a hard design problem: everything depends on everything else. It's important to map out all of the required changes in advance, before we start implementation.
