# The Geometry Processing Model

The new modeling language has two subsets:
* A high level, abstract, implementation-independent subset.
  Easy to use and suitable for novices and designers.
  The high level API is designed to support efficient preview,
  which means it imposes some restrictions not present in OpenSCAD.
  The high level API hides the implementation: you don't write code
  that assumes a mesh implementation. You don't write `cylinder(r,$fn=6)`
  to construct a hexagon prism.
* A low level subset, suitable for expert users.
  It provides low level control over the geometry engine.
  It can be used to code new geometric primitives, and provides
  full access to the internal representation of objects.
  This part will vary between different OpenSCAD implementations.

As with OpenSCAD, there is a two stage processing model.
* In the first "evaluation" phase, we generate an abstract CSG tree.
* In the second geometry or "efiguration" phase, we convert the CSG tree into
  a geometric representation: B-Rep or F-Rep, which is then used
  for rendering as a preview or exporting to a file.

The current OpenSCAD implementation of phase 2 generates a mesh from the bottom up.
For the F-Rep implementation, I intend to create different F-Rep
representations of a given abstract object, conditional on what
operations are applied to it higher in the CSG tree.
This design is one of the unique contributions of this project:
it's needed to preserve the abstraction of the high level API,
and avoid bugs in ImplicitCAD and Antimony that are caused by
their bottom-up F-Rep architecture.

During efiguration, geometric information is propagated in two directions along
the CSG tree: bottom up and top down. This is like the distinction
between inherited and synthesized attributes in attribute grammars.
To make this work, we'll need "geometric attributes".

These are high level, synthesized attributes
that can be queried during evaluation using the high level API:
* `is_polytope`: this is only true for objects that are actual polygons
  or polyhedra in the abstract model, like a square, cube or pyramid.
  It is false for any object with curved surfaces, like a sphere.
  If is_polytope is true, then the vertexes and faces can be efficiently queried
  during evaluation, which means it is false for the output of CSG operations.
* `is_convex_polytope`: I'd like to support the Conway polyhedron operators,
  which mostly only make sense for convex polyhedra. This attribute permits
  type checking and error reporting for bad arguments.
* `has_bounding_box`: This is true for any shape for which a precise bounding box
  can be efficiently computed at preview time. It's true for cubes and spheres,
  true for the output of union and intersection, false for the output of difference.
  If true, then the bounding box can be queried during evaluation.

In order to implement F-Rep both *abstractly* and *correctly*,
some geometric primitives must choose between several different implementations,
based on what operators are applied to their output higher in the tree.
None of the open source F-Rep solid modelers that I have looked at so far do this:
they either produce incorrect output, or they force users to be aware of these
weird implementation details and manually select the correct implementation.
My design fixes these problems using inherited attributes, which are not
exposed by the high level API.
