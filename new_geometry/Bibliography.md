# F-Rep Bibliography

## Origins
### R-Functions
[Analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry)
gives us the ability to visualize a geometric shape that corresponds to a function.
The equation for a circle has been known for centuries.
In the early 1960's, V. L. Rvachev was trying to find the equation for a rectangle.
In doing so, he created a system that solves *the inverse problem of
analytic geometry*: constructing equations for given geometric objects.
This is the theory of R-Functions, and it's the basis of F-Rep.

## F-Rep Modeling Tools

## User Interface
### Web Technology
The Web UI will have a text editor on the left, a preview window on the right.
* text editor: Ace. https://ace.c9.io/#nav=embedding
* preview window: renders preview using WebGL and ray-marching. https://www.shadertoy.com/

## Plumbing
"Flux" is a methodology for structuring complex UIs so that it is easy to reason
about their behaviour. An escape from callback hell, but it works with current web UI
technology. https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#content

## UI Design
In the future, I'd like to explore advanced direct manipulation UIs for
interacting with code and models. Better tools for visualizing the structure and relationships
in the code and the model,
debugging it, visualizing program evaluation, etc. Multi-user collaboration too.

  He won't share his code, but he describes his approach online.
