# F-Rep Bibliography

## Origins
### R-Functions
[Analytic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry)
gives us the ability to visualize a geometric shape that corresponds to a function.
The equation for a circle has been known for centuries.
In the early 1960's, V. L. Rvachev was trying to find the equation for a rectangle.
In doing so, he created a system that solves *the inverse problem of
analytic geometry*: constructing equations for given geometric objects.
This is the theory of R-Functions, and it's the basis of F-Rep.
